Please begin work on the project based on CLAUDE.md.

This session is focused on the **Design Theme Migration**.

Start by:
1. Reading and analyzing the repository structure
2. Applying the design migration milestone workflow
3. Identifying the next milestone from `docs/DESIGN_MIGRATION_MILESTONES.md`
4. Restating your understanding of the milestone
5. Producing the implementation plan before writing any code

Important:
- Do NOT write code yet
- Do NOT modify Smart Pages or Flipbook internal UI
- Only test Web builds
- Do NOT test or generate commands for Windows, macOS, Linux desktop, or Android
- Add a one liner everytime you finish a milestone to have show the current progress. no % - no x/y - just plain line above the Milestone headline.
