# Planning Directory

This directory contains active planning work for upcoming features, migrations, and changes.

## Usage

- Place planning files **directly in this directory** (not in subdirectories)
- File naming: `feature-name.md`, `migration-name.md`, etc.
- When complete, move entire file to `/docs/archive/`

## Examples

```
planning/
├── backend-layout-refactor.md (in progress)
├── navigation-rail-implementation.md (next up)
└── dark-mode-proposal.md (under consideration)
```

When `backend-layout-refactor.md` is complete, move it to `/docs/archive/backend-layout-refactor.md`
