Purpose

This document defines the typographic system for TogetherLog.

Typography carries emotional tone more than color or icons.
It must feel calm, personal, and premium without being expressive or loud.

1. Font Family (Locked)
Primary Typeface

Inter

This is the only required font family.

Rationale

Highly readable on Web and Android

Neutral, professional, modern

Excellent weight range

Performs well at all sizes

Does not impose personality

Inter allows the content to be emotional without the UI becoming emotional.

2. Serif Usage (Explicitly Disallowed for Now)

No serif fonts

No display fonts

No decorative typography

This keeps:

Consistency

Performance

Low cognitive load

Serif introduction is a future design decision, not part of V1.

3. Typographic Hierarchy

TogetherLog uses a restricted hierarchy.

Text Roles (Conceptual)

Screen titles

Section headers

Body text

Metadata / captions

No additional text roles are permitted without updating this document.

4. Weight Usage Rules

Weights are used to express hierarchy, not emphasis.

Allowed

Regular

Medium

Semibold

Forbidden

Light

Thin

ExtraBold

Black

If something needs emphasis:

Adjust spacing

Adjust placement

Adjust hierarchy
Not font weight escalation.

5. Line Height Philosophy

Line height prioritizes reading comfort, not compactness.

Rules:

Body text must breathe

No tight leading

No dense paragraphs

If text feels “efficient”, it is probably wrong.

6. Alignment Rules

Left-aligned text only

No centered body text

No justified text

Centering is reserved for very short, intentional content only (e.g. empty states).

7. Text Color Usage (Conceptual)

Typography color communicates hierarchy.

Rules:

Primary text: strongest contrast

Secondary text: muted

Metadata: clearly de-emphasized

Color must never replace hierarchy.

8. Microcopy Tone

Text should feel:

Calm

Personal

Respectful

Non-technical

Avoid:

Jargon

Humor

Marketing language

Overly clever phrasing

The UI should never talk more than necessary.

9. Forbidden Practices

The following are explicitly forbidden:

Multiple font families

Decorative fonts

Random font size adjustments

Using typography as decoration

Inconsistent text styles across screens

Any of these breaks the premium tone.

10. Typography Integrity Rule

If text styling draws attention to itself, it is incorrect.

Typography should disappear and let content speak.
